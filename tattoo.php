  <a target="_blank" href="traditional.html">
    <img src="traditional.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="500" height="500">
  </a>
  <div class="desc">The traditional style was born on the high seas during the 1700s, after sailors like those who sailed with Capitan James Cook first encountered indigenous communities with tattoos and, becoming inspired by their bodily markings, decided to start collecting body art as mementos of their long voyages. Over the course of the 19th century, the style became more refined taking on the boldly lined and brightly colored aesthetic seen in the work of well-known American tattooists of the 1900s like Sailor Jerry. <a href="traditional.html"> See more</a></div>

  </a>
  <div class="desc">The traditional Japanese style, aka Irezumi, originated during the Edo period (1603-1868) alongside ukiyo-e-woodblock prints that were hugely popular among the merchant class at the time. Because of this, the icons found in this time-tested genre of body art come from the country's age-old folklore, featuring tattooed heroes from the Suikoden and mythological creatures like dragons,phoenixes etc.<a href="japenese.html">See more</a> </div>

  <h2 class="heading1">Geometric</h2>
  <a target="_blank" href="lights.jpg">
    <img src="geometric.jpg" alt="Northern Lights" width="500" height="500">
  </a>
  <div class="desc">Geometric tattoo designs have existed since ancient times, and many of these symbols live on today. Based on simple mathematical patterns, these designs show the shapes hidden in nature-like the triangle in a fox's face or the rectangle in a tree's trunk. Some of the oldest geometrical designs have ties to religious or spiritual practices, representing that which was believed to be 'sacred'. Many feature repeating lines that show perfect balance and symmetry. Browse through our list of geometrical tattoos meanings, and you can ‘read between the lines' next time you see someone with one of these smart tattoos.<a href="geometrical.html">See more</a></div>

  <h2 class="heading1">Tribal</h2>
  <a target="_blank" href="mountains.jpg">
    <img src="tribal.jpg" alt="Mountains" width="500" height="500">
  </a>
  <div class="desc">Tribal tattoos: i.e. indigenous body art — are the oldest in the world, dating back thousands of years. This style should actually be thought of as multiple styles or more so different traditions of tattooing from aboriginal communities all around the globe. These diverse and beautiful styles are frequently referred to under the umbrella term "tribal," but to the trained eye, Polynesian body art is distinctive from Marquesan just like tattoos on Inupiaq matriarchs' faces are different from those found on Berber women. Though these styles are all unique, they are somewhat similar-almost always done in black with elaborate patterns.<a href="tribal.html">See more</a> </div>

  </a>
  <div class="desc1">Fine line tattooing is one of the newer styles you'll find in tattoo shops and has been achievable because of the improvements made with tattoo machines, inks, and needles. Artists today are able to add more detail and special effects to their artwork. Fine line is often used in portrait tattoos or to achieve a delicate look.<a href="fineline.html">See more </a> </div>
